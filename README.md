# JSON-UI Dumper

The website is still on it's early stages and anything seen is not final!

[Click to see the website](https://theoristmc.github.io/JSON-UI-Dumper/)

Dumps all available elements seen on the vanilla UI, generated based on the latest bedrock samples.

## Goals

- Better code format, supporting multiple colors and etc..
- Allow users to switch between latest stable/preview
- ~~Dumps all properties with accuracies~~

## Fix
- Save checkbox states so even if the user scrolls, the checkbox is still expanded
